# MathCoroutines

It uses Coroutines to calculate the Nth Fibonacci number and tells you a fun fact about that number N!

You can either choose to get the fun fact or not. 
If you want it, we'll display the result only when the calculation finishes and we get a successful network request (when getting the fun fact!).
